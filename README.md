# Project Name

Week 4 project was to create a chatbot using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Ida NÃ¤slund and myself created a 'Hairdo chatbot' for booking hairdresser appointment
## The problem

Our first hurdle was to start the intial chat conversation after the greeting message. Inspecting the example chatbot helped to understand how to invoke the function. The next hurdle was to prevent default page refresh of input type form.
